Codenames is a game for two teams of at least two players each. One player on each team is the "spymaster," and the other players on the team are the "field operatives." The game is played on a grid of cards, with each card representing a word. The spymasters give one-word clues to their field operatives, who then try to guess which card the clue is referring to. The first team to guess all of their cards correctly wins the game. A good hint associates multiple words from one team, without accidentally applying to words belonging to the opposite team.

Blue Hint
Blue Words: wave, crown, shop, smuggler, centaur, fair, tick, hand
Thought Process: Wave and hand are related, but I'm not sure what word can relate them that isn't "wave". Maybe "greeting"? Since you greet people by waving and also by shaking hands.

Red Hint
